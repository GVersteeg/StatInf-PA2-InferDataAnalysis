# StatInf-PA2-InferDataAnalysis


Exploratory Data Analysis -- includes at least one chart of the types that we learned in the Exploratory Data Analysis class, along with some commentary explaining the distribution / basic features of the data in the study
Key Assumptions -- explains key assumptions made for the hypothesis tests
Hypothesis Tests -- using techniques learned in this class, analyze the data
Conclusions -- given your hypothesis tests, explain how Vitamin C is related to tooth growth in guinea pigs
Also, since the Reproducible Research class taught us to include a Synopsis or Executive Summary section, I'd include a Synopsis that summarizes the entire analysis in 4 - 6 bullet points.
